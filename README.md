# CSS Governance — Public Anchor Proofs

**Bitcoin-timestamped Merkle roots for sovereign artefact verification.**

This repository contains publicly retrievable cryptographic proofs generated by the [Sovereign Artefact Registry](https://github.com/Andy160675/sovereign-artefact-registry). Each anchor consists of:

- **`.root`** — The raw Merkle root hash (64 hex characters)
- **`.root.ots`** — The OpenTimestamps proof file anchored to the Bitcoin blockchain
- **`anchors.jsonl`** — The full anchor record with metadata, config hash, and OTS hash

## Verification

Anyone can independently verify a proof:

```bash
# Install OpenTimestamps
pip install opentimestamps-client

# Download and verify a proof
ots verify public/css_internal/2026-02-28T15-07-29Z.root.ots
```

The SHA-256 hash of the `.ots` file must match the `ots_hash` field in `anchors.jsonl`.

## Structure

```
public/
  {client_handle}/
    anchors.jsonl          # Append-only anchor log
    {timestamp}.root       # Raw Merkle root
    {timestamp}.root.ots   # OTS Bitcoin proof
```

## Trust Model

- **T0 (Deterministic)**: Merkle tree computation, SHA-256 hashing
- **T1 (Human-Verified)**: Registry entry creation, config validation
- **T2 (Probabilistic)**: OTS calendar server submission
- **Bitcoin Finality**: Proof is immutable once confirmed on-chain
